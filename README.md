# Lessons Learned# BlackjackProject

This weeks homework was the most challenging so far.
I found the hardest part to be setting up the class structure. 
It was a real challenge to decide what classes would be necessary, 
which would be helpful, and which would be overkill.
I spent an uncomfortable amount of time creating and deleting classes.
The positive aspect was once I had the class structure completed, 
the syntax was much easier to follow.
I tried to follow advice of the TAâ€™s more on this project 
as far as writing in English first, then writing the code.
It helped tremendously. 
I learned a lot about the flow of information and the syntax needed 
to get from one point to another. Still lots to learn.
